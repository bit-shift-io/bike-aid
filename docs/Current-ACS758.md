# ACS758LCB-050B Current Sensor
ACS758LCB-050B Range Linear Current Sensor Analog Signal Output for Arduino Hall Effect Based
Features and Benefits

## Notes

Maximum current: 100A
Voltage：3.3-5V
temperature：-41°C ~ 152°C
Industry-leading noise performance through proprietary amplifier and filter design techniques
Integrated shield greatly reduces capacitive coupling from current conductor to die due to high dV/dt signals, and prevents offset drift in high-side, high voltage applications
Total output error improvement through gain and offset trim over temperature
Small package size, with easy mounting capability
Monolithic Hall IC for high reliability
Ultra-low power loss: 100 μΩ internal conductor resistance
Galvanic isolation allows use in economical, high-side current sensing in high voltage systems
3.0 to 5.5 V, single supply operation
120 kHz typical bandwidth
3 μs output rise time in response to step input current
Output voltage proportional to AC or DC currents
Factory-trimmed for accuracy
Extremely stable output offset voltage
Nearly zero magnetic hysteresis
