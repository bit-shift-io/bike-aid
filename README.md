# bike-aid

This is an ebike govenor which does the following:

* Bluetooth interface
* Power toggle
* Lights toggle
* Horn toggle
* Battery power, voltage, current meter
* Alarm system
* Speedometer
* Odometer
* Trip duration
* Throttle smoothing
* Throttle limiting / speed limiting
* Throttle deadband adjustment

## Purpose

I designed this tool as a controller to act as a interface for controlling my ebike. I have had a few ebikes now, and they are all missing basic features I wanted.

## Where to start

* mcu-nrf-rs - mcu software
* app-java - android app  
* docs - documentation
* diagrams - circuit diagrams
* everything else is old!
